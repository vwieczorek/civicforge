curl -s http://YOUR_AWS_IP:8000/api/theme/gamified | jq '.rewards.task_rewards.complex'

## Conclusion

The theme system with rewards configuration is successfully deployed and functional on AWS. Users can:
- Browse and switch between themes

The only minor issue is the theme editor route, which may require authentication or be at a different path.
