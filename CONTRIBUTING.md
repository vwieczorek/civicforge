# Contributing to CivicForge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CivicForge! We're building a conversation-driven approach to civic engagement, and we need thoughtful contributors to help shape this vision.

## Current Phase

CivicForge is in the **vision and architecture phase**. We're not writing code yet - we're designing how humans and AI can collaborate to strengthen communities.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Understand the Vision
- Read our [README](./README.md) for an overview
- Study the [Civic Compass Vision](./civic-compass-vision/CIVIC_COMPASS_CIVICFORGE_VISION.md)
- Review the [Technical Architecture](./civic-compass-vision/CIVIC_COMPASS_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md)

### 2. Areas We Need Help

#### Architecture & Design
- Distributed systems design
- Privacy-preserving protocols
- Natural language interfaces
- Decentralized identity (DIDs)

#### Community & Governance
- Community hub governance models
- Reputation system design
- Incentive mechanisms
- Trust frameworks

#### User Experience
- Conversational UI patterns
- Accessibility considerations
- Multi-language support
- Offline capabilities

### 3. How to Submit Ideas

1. **Open an Issue** - Start a discussion about your idea
2. **Be Specific** - Reference which component or principle your idea relates to
3. **Think Human-First** - Remember: AI guides, humans decide

### 4. Design Principles

All contributions should align with our core principles:

- **Human Agency** - Technology amplifies human capability, doesn't replace it
- **Privacy by Design** - Not as an afterthought
- **Community Ownership** - Federated, not centralized
- **Natural Interaction** - Conversation over complexity
- **Inclusive Access** - Works for everyone

### 5. Communication

- **Issues** - For feature discussions and architecture decisions
- **Discussions** - For broader philosophy and approach questions
- **Pull Requests** - Currently only for documentation improvements
