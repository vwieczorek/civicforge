# Security Policy

## Our Security Commitment

CivicForge takes security and privacy seriously. As a platform designed to facilitate civic engagement through AI assistance, we recognize the critical importance of protecting user data and maintaining trust.

## Security Principles

1. **Privacy by Design** - Security isn't added later; it's built into every architectural decision
2. **Local-First** - Sensitive data stays on user devices whenever possible
3. **Cryptographic Guarantees** - Trust through mathematics, not promises
4. **Transparent Operations** - Users can verify what their AI assistant is doing

## Architecture Security Features

### Hybrid Agent Model
- Private keys never leave the Local Controller
- Remote Thinker operates on encrypted/anonymized data
- All actions require explicit user approval

### Decentralized Identity
- Self-sovereign identity through W3C DIDs
- No central authority can impersonate users
- Verifiable credentials for all civic actions

### Privacy Technologies
- Homomorphic encryption for remote processing
- Local embeddings before cloud analysis
- Privacy budget to prevent profiling
- Zero-knowledge proofs where applicable

## Reporting Security Issues

As we're currently in the vision phase, security concerns would likely be architectural rather than implementation bugs. However, if you identify security issues in our design:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email** security@civicforge.org (coming soon)
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the issue
   - Which component/design it affects
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested mitigation

## Security Considerations for Contributors

When contributing to the architecture:

1. **Assume Compromise** - Design assuming any component could be compromised
2. **Minimize Trust** - Reduce the need to trust any single entity
3. **Fail Secure** - When something goes wrong, fail in a way that protects users
4. **Audit Everything** - Design for verifiability and accountability

## Future Security Measures

As we move toward implementation:

- Security audits of all cryptographic protocols
- Formal verification of critical components
- Bug bounty program
- Regular penetration testing
- Transparent security reports
