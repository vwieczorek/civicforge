## Viral Hooks That Work

1. **The Comparison**: "I ordered pizza faster than I could sign up to volunteer"
2. **The Challenge**: "Can you find the submit button?" (It doesn't exist)
3. **The Reveal**: "This 47-page PDF is real. From my actual city."
4. **The Testimony**: "I tried to help. Here's what happened..."
5. **The Stunt**: "I'll do [ridiculous thing] if signing up takes over 5 minutes" (it will)

---

## Music/Audio Strategy

- Use trending TikTok sounds when they fit
- Create original "bureaucracy music" (muzak from hell)
- Sound effects are crucial (error sounds, victory sounds)
- Design for both sound-on and sound-off viewing
- Captions always on with personality

---

## Success Metrics

- Shares > Views (virality indicator)
- Comments about personal frustrations
- "Where has this been?" responses  
- Media pickup potential
- Actual signups from video traffic

---

Remember: Make them laugh, make them mad (at bureaucracy), make them hope. In that order.
