# CivicForge Civic Compass Vision

## Overview

This directory contains the architectural vision for CivicForge's transformation into a conversation-driven civic engagement platform. The Civic Compass paradigm puts AI in service of human community building.

## Key Documents

### Core Vision & Architecture
- **[CIVIC_COMPASS_CIVICFORGE_VISION.md](./CIVIC_COMPASS_CIVICFORGE_VISION.md)** - Complete architectural vision focusing on the Hybrid Agent Model
- **[CIVIC_COMPASS_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](./CIVIC_COMPASS_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md)** - Technical implementation details for core components
- **[CIVIC_COMPASS_PROTOTYPE.md](./CIVIC_COMPASS_PROTOTYPE.md)** - MVP roadmap prioritizing essential features

### Design Process
- **[DESIGN_PROCESS.md](./DESIGN_PROCESS.md)** - Evolution from initial concept to human-centric design
- **[CIVIC_COMPASS_DEFENSE_SUMMARY.md](./CIVIC_COMPASS_DEFENSE_SUMMARY.md)** - Key architectural decisions and tradeoffs

### Communication Materials
- Audio scripts and video prompts for explaining the vision to different audiences
- SSML generation tools for creating audio content

## Top Priority Features

1. **Hybrid Agent Model** - Local Controller + Remote Thinker architecture
2. **W3C DIDs** - Decentralized identity infrastructure  
3. **Federated P2P Network** - Community-owned hubs
4. **Natural Language Interface** - Conversational civic engagement
5. **Privacy Architecture** - Local processing, cryptographic guarantees

## Reading Order

For developers and contributors:
1. Start with this README
2. Read CIVIC_COMPASS_CIVICFORGE_VISION.md for conceptual understanding
3. Review CIVIC_COMPASS_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md for implementation details
4. Check CIVIC_COMPASS_PROTOTYPE.md for development priorities

## Design Principles

- **Human agency first** - AI guides but humans decide
- **Privacy by design** - Not privacy as an afterthought
- **Community ownership** - Federated, not centralized
- **Natural interaction** - Conversation, not forms
- **Inclusive access** - Works for everyone, not just tech-savvy

## Status

Currently in vision and architecture phase. Seeking contributors for:
- Distributed systems architecture
- Natural language processing
- Decentralized identity (DIDs)
- Privacy-preserving protocols
- Community engagement design
