# ADR-001: API Authentication Strategy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-01-17
- **Context:** The API endpoints were initially deployed without authentication, creating a critical security vulnerability where anyone could access and modify user data.

## Decision

We implemented JWT-based authentication using AWS Cognito as the identity provider, with API Gateway performing automatic token validation.

### Implementation Details:
1. Cognito JWT authorizer configured at the `httpApi` level in serverless.yml
2. All endpoints require authentication by default
3. Public endpoints must explicitly set `authorizer: none`
4. Frontend uses AWS Amplify for token management

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Security**: All API endpoints are now protected by default
- **Scalability**: Stateless JWT tokens scale horizontally
- **Standards**: Using industry-standard OAuth2/OIDC flows
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS services
- **User Experience**: Automatic token refresh handled by Amplify

### Negative:
- **Complexity**: Developers must understand JWT token flow
- **Testing**: Tests require mock authentication setup
- **Debugging**: Token validation errors can be opaque
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to AWS Cognito (mitigated by standard JWT)

### Trade-offs:
- Chose Cognito over custom auth for faster implementation and better security
- Chose JWT over sessions for stateless scalability
- Default-secure approach may require more explicit configuration for public endpoints

## Alternatives Considered

1. **API Keys**: Rejected due to poor security and key management complexity
2. **Basic Auth**: Rejected due to security concerns and poor UX
3. **Custom JWT**: Rejected due to implementation complexity and security risks
4. **AWS IAM**: Rejected due to frontend integration complexity
