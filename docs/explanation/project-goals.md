# CivicForge Project Goals and Vision

## Mission Statement

CivicForge enables peer-to-peer trust through dual-attestation of community quests. We're building a platform where community members can create quests (tasks/projects), have them completed by other members, and verify completion through a dual-attestation system.

## Core Values

1. **Trust Through Verification**: Every completed quest requires attestation from both the requestor and performer
2. **Community-Driven**: The platform is built for and by the community
3. **Transparency**: All quests and attestations are publicly auditable
4. **Security First**: Cryptographic verification and secure architecture are paramount

## MVP Goals

The Minimum Viable Product focuses on delivering the core quest lifecycle:

### Essential Features
- User authentication via AWS Cognito
- Quest creation with point-based anti-spam system
- Quest claiming by performers
- Work submission and evidence
- Dual attestation system
- XP and reputation rewards
- Basic dispute mechanism

### Technical Requirements
- Frontend test coverage: >70%
- Backend test coverage: >85%
- All critical paths tested
- Security hardening complete
- Documentation up to date

## Long-term Vision

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current MVP)
- Core quest lifecycle
- Basic reputation system
- Manual dispute resolution

### Phase 2: Enhanced Trust
- Cryptographic signature verification
- On-chain attestation records
- Automated dispute resolution

### Phase 3: Scale & Ecosystem
- Multi-community support
- Quest templates and categories
- Advanced reputation algorithms
- Integration with other platforms

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- System uptime >99.9%
- Response time <500ms
- Zero security incidents
- Test coverage maintained above targets

### Community
- Active monthly users
- Quest completion rate >80%
- Average attestation time <24 hours
- User satisfaction score >4/5

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: The UI should be intuitive for non-technical users
2. **Reliability**: The system must be robust and handle failures gracefully
3. **Scalability**: Architecture should support growth without major rewrites
4. **Inclusivity**: The platform should be accessible to all community members

## Current Status (January 2025)

The project is approximately 1-2 weeks from MVP launch, with the following remaining work:
- Frontend test coverage improvement (currently ~30%, needs 70%)
- Final integration testing
- Performance validation
- Security review

The backend is production-ready with 85% test coverage and hardened security.
