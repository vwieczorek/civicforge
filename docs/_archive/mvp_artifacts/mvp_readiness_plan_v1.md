# CivicForge MVP Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

CivicForge is approaching MVP readiness with strong backend infrastructure (85.43% test coverage) but faces critical blockers in frontend testing (19.51% coverage) and security vulnerabilities. This plan outlines the path to production deployment using multiple teams working in parallel.

## Current State Analysis

### Deployment Readiness by Component

| Component | Status | Coverage | Target | Blocker |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Backend API | ✅ Ready | 85.43% | 70% | None |
| Frontend UI | ❌ Blocked | 19.51% | 70% | Test failures |
| Infrastructure | ✅ Ready | N/A | N/A | None |
| Security | ⚠️ Issues | N/A | N/A | IAM permissions |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | N/A | N/A | None |

### Critical Issues Summary

1. **[CRITICAL] Frontend Test Coverage Gap**
   - Current: 19.51% vs Target: 70%
   - 11/14 test files failing
   - Primary deployment blocker

2. **[CRITICAL] Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Overly permissive IAM roles for Lambda functions
   - Missing tests for critical rewards reprocessor
   - Attestation logic bug allowing duplicate role attestations

3. **[HIGH] User Experience Issues**
   - No feedback on quest creation failures
   - Missing error handling in UI components

## Team-Based Implementation Plan

Each team has detailed implementation guides with code examples, testing procedures, and success criteria:

### Team A: Security & Backend (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Timeline: 3-4 days**
**[Full Implementation Guide](./SECURITY_FIXES_TEAM_A.md)**

Key deliverables:
- Fix IAM permissions using condition keys for attestQuest Lambda
- Create isolated wallet update Lambda with restricted permissions
- Fix attestation duplication bug in db.py
- Create comprehensive tests for rewards reprocessor (100% coverage target)
- Document API contract for frontend team

### Team B: Frontend Testing (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Timeline: 4-5 days**
**[Full Implementation Guide](./FRONTEND_STABILIZATION_TEAM_B.md)**

Key deliverables:
- Fix E2E test environment configuration
- Stabilize MSW mocking layer with centralized handlers
- Resolve all React act() warnings in tests
- Fix component prop mismatches
- Implement critical path E2E test

### Team C: DevOps & Integration (Priority: HIGH)
**Timeline: Concurrent with Teams A & B, then 2-3 days post-fixes**
**[Full Implementation Guide](./OPERATIONS_DEPLOYMENT_TEAM_C.md)**

Key deliverables:
- Support Team B with E2E environment setup (Docker Compose)
- Implement feature flag system using AWS AppConfig
- Optimize Lambda performance (move clients outside handlers)
- Create canary deployment pipeline with automatic rollback
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Critical Path Items (Must Complete)

1. **Frontend Test Coverage** (Team B)
   - [ ] Fix React Router configuration in all tests
   - [ ] Resolve async/act warnings
   - [ ] Fix 11 failing test files
   - [ ] Add tests for 3 missing components
   - [ ] Achieve 70% coverage

2. **Security Fixes** (Team A)
   - [ ] Restrict attestQuest IAM permissions
   - [ ] Create isolated wallet update Lambda
   - [ ] Fix attestation duplication bug
   - [ ] Add tests for rewards reprocessor

3. **User Experience** (Team B)
   - [ ] Add error handling to CreateQuest
   - [ ] Display API errors to users
   - [ ] Fix loading states

### Nice-to-Have Items (Post-MVP)

- Performance optimization for DynamoDB client initialization
- Additional E2E test scenarios
- Enhanced monitoring dashboards
- API rate limiting implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Test Flakiness**
   - Mitigation: Use proper async handling, avoid time-dependent tests
   - Fallback: Focus on critical path tests first

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Principle of least privilege, comprehensive testing
   - Fallback: Additional security audit before production

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Thorough staging testing
   - Fallback: Phased rollout with feature flags

### Process Risks

1. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Mitigation: Daily standups, clear priorities
   - Fallback: Focus on critical blockers only

2. **Team Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Clear interfaces, parallel work streams
   - Fallback: Cross-team knowledge sharing

## Success Criteria

### MVP Launch Requirements

- [ ] Frontend test coverage ≥ 70%
- [ ] All critical security issues resolved
- [ ] Zero failing tests in CI/CD
- [ ] Successful staging deployment
- [ ] E2E tests passing in staging
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Operational runbook updated
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-offs obtained

### Quality Gates

1. **Pre-Staging**
   - All tests passing locally
   - Security vulnerabilities resolved
   - Code review completed

2. **Pre-Production**
   - Staging deployment stable for 24 hours
   - E2E tests passing consistently
   - Performance metrics acceptable
   - Security audit passed

## Timeline Summary

```
Week 1:
Mon-Tue: Security fixes (Team A) | Test infrastructure (Team B) | Staging prep (Team C)
Wed-Thu: Rewards tests (Team A) | Component tests (Team B) | Monitoring setup (Team C)
Fri: Integration prep, code reviews

Week 2:
Mon: Staging deployment & testing
Tue: E2E testing & rollback tests
Wed: Final fixes & stakeholder demos
Thu: Production deployment decision
Fri: Production deployment (if approved)
```

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups
- 9 AM: Cross-team sync
- Focus: Blockers, dependencies, progress

### Status Updates
- Daily: Slack updates in #civicforge-mvp
- EOD: Progress against success criteria

### Escalation Path
1. Team leads for technical decisions
2. Project manager for timeline/scope
3. Stakeholders for go/no-go decisions

## Post-MVP Roadmap

Once MVP is deployed:

1. **Week 1**: Monitor production metrics, address any issues
2. **Week 2**: Implement nice-to-have features
3. **Week 3**: Performance optimizations
4. **Month 2**: Feature enhancements based on user feedback

## Conclusion

The path to MVP is clear with frontend testing as the primary blocker. With focused effort from three parallel teams, we can achieve production readiness within 1.5-2 weeks. The key is maintaining clear communication, focusing on critical path items, and ensuring comprehensive testing before each deployment stage.
