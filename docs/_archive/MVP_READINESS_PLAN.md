# CivicForge MVP Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

CivicForge is well-architected with a robust backend (85% test coverage) and comprehensive infrastructure. The **sole blocker** for MVP deployment is frontend test coverage (~25% vs 70% required). This plan outlines three parallel workstreams to achieve deployment readiness.

## Current Status

### ✅ Ready
- **Backend**: 85.43% test coverage (exceeds 70% requirement)
- **Infrastructure**: Complete serverless setup with deployment scripts
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architecture, operations, and deployment docs
- **Security**: JWT auth, IAM roles, input validation implemented

### ❌ Blockers
- **Frontend Test Coverage**: ~25% (requires 70%)
  - Critical components with 0% coverage: QuestDetail, QuestAttestationForm, QuestList, UserProfile

## Deployment Readiness Workstreams

### Workstream 1: Frontend Testing Sprint (Owner: Frontend Team)
**Timeline: 5-7 days | Priority: CRITICAL**

#### Phase 1: E2E Critical Path Tests (Days 1-3)
Using Playwright (recommended based on 2024 analysis):

**Test Implementation Priority:**
1. **User Authentication Flow** (Day 1)
   - Register new user
   - Login/logout
   - Protected route access

2. **Quest Lifecycle** (Day 2)
   - Create quest with valid data
   - View quest details
   - Search and filter quests

3. **Attestation Process** (Day 2-3)
   - Submit attestation
   - View attestation status
   - Validate dual-attestation requirement

4. **Reward Flow** (Day 3)
   - Claim rewards
   - View reward history
   - Handle failed reward scenarios

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Install Playwright
cd frontend
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Generate initial tests
npx playwright codegen https://localhost:5173

# Run tests
npx playwright test
```

#### Phase 2: Component Unit Tests (Days 3-5)
Focus on business logic and user interactions:

**High Priority Components:**
1. **QuestList.tsx**
   - Rendering with various quest states
   - Pagination logic
   - Filter functionality
   - Error states

2. **QuestDetail.tsx**
   - Quest data display
   - Attestation button states
   - Creator vs participant views
   - Loading states

3. **QuestAttestationForm.tsx**
   - Form validation
   - Submission flow
   - Error handling
   - Success feedback

4. **UserProfile.tsx**
   - Profile data display
   - Quest history
   - Reward summary
   - Edit capabilities

**Test Template:**
```typescript
// Example for QuestList.test.tsx
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import QuestList from './QuestList';

describe('QuestList', () => {
  it('displays quests when loaded', async () => {
    // Mock API response
    const mockQuests = [/* test data */];
    vi.mocked(getQuests).mockResolvedValue(mockQuests);
    
    render(<QuestList />);
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText(mockQuests[0].title)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
  
  // Add more test cases...
});
```

#### Phase 3: Coverage Gap Analysis (Days 5-7)
1. Run coverage report: `npm run coverage`
2. Identify remaining gaps
3. Add targeted tests for uncovered branches
4. Implement visual regression tests for key UI components

### Workstream 2: Production Hardening (Owner: DevOps/Backend Team)
**Timeline: 3-5 days | Priority: HIGH**

#### Observability Enhancement (Days 1-2)
1. **Structured Logging**
   - Add correlation IDs to all requests
   - Implement log aggregation queries
   - Create CloudWatch Insights dashboards

2. **Metrics Dashboard**
   - Four Golden Signals (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation)
   - Business metrics (quests created, attestations, rewards)
   - User engagement metrics

3. **Alerting Rules**
   ```yaml
   # Example CloudWatch alarm
   ErrorRateAlarm:
     Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
     Properties:
       AlarmName: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-high-error-rate
       MetricName: Errors
       Threshold: 5
       EvaluationPeriods: 2
       Period: 300
   ```

#### Security Audit (Days 2-3)
1. **Dependency Scan**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   pip install safety
   safety check
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm audit
   npm audit fix --force  # Review changes carefully
   ```

2. **Secrets Management Review**
   - Verify no hardcoded secrets
   - Rotate all API keys
   - Implement secret rotation schedule

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting verification
   - Input validation audit
   - CORS configuration review

#### Deployment Testing (Days 3-5)
1. **Staging Deployment Drill**
   - Full deployment to staging
   - Run E2E test suite
   - Verify all integrations

2. **Rollback Procedure Test**
   - Simulate failed deployment
   - Execute rollback
   - Verify system recovery

3. **Load Testing**
   ```bash
   # Using k6 for load testing
   k6 run --vus 50 --duration 5m load-test.js
   ```

### Workstream 3: Operational Readiness (Owner: Product/Operations Team)
**Timeline: 2-3 days | Priority: MEDIUM**

#### Documentation Updates (Day 1)
1. **Create Operational Runbook**
   - Incident response procedures
   - Common troubleshooting steps
   - Escalation paths

2. **Update Deployment Documentation**
   - Add frontend test requirements
   - Include rollback procedures
   - Document monitoring setup

#### Launch Preparation (Days 2-3)
1. **Communication Channels**
   - Set up status page
   - Configure user feedback mechanism
   - Prepare launch announcements

2. **Support Infrastructure**
   - Create FAQ documentation
   - Set up support ticket system
   - Define SLAs

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### Must Have (Blockers)
- [ ] Frontend test coverage ≥ 70%
- [ ] All critical path E2E tests passing
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Successful staging deployment with rollback test
- [ ] Operational runbook completed and reviewed

### Should Have
- [ ] Visual regression tests implemented
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Advanced monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline

### Nice to Have
- [ ] A/B testing framework
- [ ] Feature flag system beyond basic implementation
- [ ] Advanced analytics integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Test Quality vs Coverage
**Mitigation**: Focus on critical user journeys first, ensure tests are meaningful not just coverage-padding

### Risk 2: Deployment Failures
**Mitigation**: Multiple staging rehearsals, documented rollback procedures, feature flags for gradual rollout

### Risk 3: Performance Issues
**Mitigation**: Load testing in staging, auto-scaling configured, caching strategy implemented

## Success Metrics

### Pre-Launch
- Frontend test coverage ≥ 70%
- All E2E tests passing
- < 5 minute deployment time
- < 1 minute rollback time

### Post-Launch (First Week)
- < 1% error rate
- < 500ms p95 latency
- > 99.9% uptime
- < 24hr issue resolution time

## Team Assignments

### Frontend Team
- Lead: Focus on E2E test framework setup
- Dev 1: Component unit tests (QuestList, QuestDetail)
- Dev 2: Component unit tests (Attestation, UserProfile)

**Day 5-6**: Coverage gap analysis, deployment testing
**Day 7**: Final integration, go/no-go decision

## Conclusion

With focused execution on frontend testing and parallel work on production hardening, CivicForge can achieve MVP readiness within 7 days. The testing infrastructure exists; we need disciplined execution on test implementation.
