# Testing Infrastructure Update Summary

**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Status**: Documentation Updated for Clean Slate

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Reorganization
- **Archived**: `MVP_READINESS_PLAN.md` â†’ `docs/archive/` (served its planning purpose)
- **Promoted**: `TESTING_STATUS.md` as the single source of truth for testing state
- **Created**: `frontend/TESTING.md` with testing standards and patterns

### 2. Testing Infrastructure Improvements

#### âœ… Completed
- **API Client Tests**: Migrated from manual fetch mocks to MSW (13/13 passing)
- **E2E Framework**: Playwright configured with critical path tests
  - Authentication flow (`e2e/auth.setup.ts`)
  - Quest discovery (`e2e/quest-discovery.spec.ts`)
  - Quest interaction (`e2e/quest-interaction.spec.ts`)
  - Quest attestation (`e2e/quest-attestation.spec.ts`)
- **Testing Standards**: Established MSW as the only approved mocking method

#### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Frontend unit test coverage: ~25% (target: 70%)
- Component tests need migration from manual mocks to MSW

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Added E2E test commands
- Linked to TESTING_STATUS.md for coverage details
- Added Testing Standards to documentation list

#### CONTRIBUTING.md
- Added E2E testing section with Playwright commands
- Updated PR requirements to mandate tests for new features
- Added frontend component test pattern example
- Linked to testing documentation

#### TESTING_STATUS.md
- Added header establishing it as source of truth
- Updated with current testing infrastructure status
- Documented completed E2E tests
- Clear roadmap for remaining work

#### DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- Updated references from MVP_READINESS_PLAN to TESTING_STATUS
- Marked E2E tests as completed
- Clarified remaining unit test work

### 4. Key Decisions

1. **Hybrid E2E Approach**: Real backend for happy paths, mocked for edge cases
2. **MSW Standard**: All unit/integration tests must use MSW, no manual fetch mocks
3. **Session Persistence**: E2E tests reuse auth state for efficiency
4. **Documentation Strategy**: TESTING_STATUS.md is the living document for test progress

## Next Steps

The path to 70% frontend coverage is clear:

1. **Priority 1**: Fix failing component tests by removing manual mocks
2. **Priority 2**: Focus on high-value components (QuestList, QuestDetail, QuestAttestationForm)
3. **Priority 3**: Delete low-value tests that don't provide meaningful coverage

With E2E tests providing confidence in critical paths and the testing infrastructure properly configured, multiple teams can now work in parallel to achieve MVP readiness.
