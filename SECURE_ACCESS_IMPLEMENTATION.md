# Secure Access System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive secure access system for granting individual access to friends and reviewers in the CivicForge Board MVP.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (✅ Complete)
Added two new tables to support the access system:

- **board_invites**: Stores invitation tokens with expiration and usage limits
  - Fields: board_id, created_by_user_id, invite_token, email, role, permissions, max_uses, used_count, expires_at
  - Indexes on invite_token and board_id for performance

- **board_memberships**: Tracks user memberships and permissions per board
  - Fields: board_id, user_id, role, permissions, invited_by_user_id, invite_id, joined_at
  - Unique constraint on (board_id, user_id)
  - Indexes on board_id and user_id

### 2. Permission System (✅ Complete)
Implemented role-based access control with 5 predefined roles:

- **Owner**: Full control including member management
- **Organizer**: Can create quests and invites, view analytics
- **Reviewer**: Can verify quests and view analytics  
- **Friend**: Can create, claim, and verify quests
- **Participant**: Basic access to claim quests and submit work

### 3. Authentication Extensions (✅ Complete)
Enhanced auth.py with:
- `generate_invite_token()`: Creates cryptographically secure tokens
- `create_board_invite()`: Generates invitation with configurable parameters
- `validate_invite_token()`: Validates token expiry and usage
- `check_permission()`: Verifies specific permissions
- `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`: Centralized permission definitions

### 4. API Endpoints (✅ Complete)

#### Invite Management
- `POST /boards/{board_id}/invites`: Create new invitations
- `POST /boards/{board_id}/join`: Accept invitation with token
- `GET /boards/{board_id}/members`: List board members
- `DELETE /boards/{board_id}/members/{user_id}`: Remove members

#### Enhanced User Endpoint
- `GET /me`: Now includes board membership and permissions

### 5. Web Interface (✅ Complete)
Added comprehensive UI for invite management:

- **/invites** page: Create invites and manage members
- **/board/{board_id}/join**: Landing page for invite links
- Navigation dynamically shows "Invites" link based on permissions
- Forms for creating invites with role selection
- Member list with removal capability

### 6. Permission Enforcement (✅ Complete)
Added permission checks to all relevant endpoints:
- Quest creation requires "create_quest" permission
- Quest claiming requires "claim_quest" permission  
- Quest verification requires "verify_quest" permission
- Default permissions grant participant access to all authenticated users

## Security Features

1. **Cryptographically Secure Tokens**: Uses Python's `secrets` module
2. **Time-Limited Invites**: Default 48-hour expiration
3. **Usage Limits**: Single-use invites by default
4. **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions per role
5. **Audit Trail**: Tracks who invited whom via invite_id
6. **Ownership Protection**: Cannot remove last owner

## Default Behavior

- All authenticated users get participant permissions by default
- First quest creator automatically becomes board owner
- Invites expire after 48 hours
- Board membership persists until explicitly removed

## Usage Example

1. **Create Invite** (as owner/organizer):
   ```
   POST /api/boards/board_001/invites
   {
     "role": "reviewer",
     "email": "reviewer@example.com",
     "max_uses": 1,
     "expires_hours": 48
   }
   ```

2. **Share Invite URL**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/board/board_001/join?token=<secure_token>
   ```

3. **Accept Invite** (after login):
   ```
   POST /api/boards/board_001/join
   {
     "token": "<secure_token>"
   }
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test invite expiration after timeout
2. Verify max_uses enforcement
3. Confirm permission inheritance works correctly
4. Test removal of members and last-owner protection
5. Verify invite links work for logged-out users

## Future Enhancements

1. Email notifications for invites
2. Invite revocation before expiry
3. Bulk invite creation
4. Custom permission sets per invite
5. Board-specific role customization
6. Invite analytics and tracking
