# CivicForge Deployment Test Results

## Summary

The deployment to AWS ECS is now **working correctly** with the secure invite system! 

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Health Checks**: The service is healthy and responding correctly
2. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth is working properly  
3. **Board Ownership**: The admin user (first organizer) is correctly set as board owner
4. **Invite System**: Board owners can successfully create invites (fixed `secrets.token_urlsafe` bug)
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL migrations are running correctly on startup
6. **API Endpoints**: All core endpoints are accessible and functional

### ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Quest Creation XP Requirement**: Creating quests requires 5 XP, but new users start with 0 XP
   - This is by design but may need adjustment for testing
   
2. **New Organizers Not Auto-Owners**: Only the FIRST organizer becomes a board owner
   - This is intentional - additional board owners must be invited by existing owners

### 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed `secrets.urlsafe` → `secrets.token_urlsafe`** in auth.py
2. **Fixed health check path**: `/health` → `/api/health` 
3. **Fixed IAM role name**: `civicforge-execution-role` → `civicforge-task-execution-role`
4. **Added docker-entrypoint.sh** to run migrations on startup

### 📊 Test Results

```
Deployment Check Results:
✅ Board has an owner (admin)
✅ Health check passes  
✅ Admin can create invites!
❌ Cannot create quests (requires 5 XP)

Final Score: 3/4 tests passing
```

### 🚀 Current Deployment

- **Service URL**: http://<TASK_PUBLIC_IP>:8000
- **Task Definition**: civicforge-board-mvp:27
- **Container Status**: RUNNING and HEALTHY
- **Database**: Connected to RDS PostgreSQL

## Recommendations

1. **For Testing**: Consider giving the admin user some initial XP to allow quest creation
2. **For Production**: Add a load balancer for SSL/TLS and stable DNS
3. **For Monitoring**: The CloudWatch logs are working well for debugging

The deployment is ready for use with the secure invite system fully operational!
