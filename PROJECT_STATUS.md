### 🚧 In Progress

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Component documentation needs completion
   - Deployment guide needs minor updates

### 📋 Recent Changes (January 17, 2025 - Security Remediation)

1. **🔒 Critical Security Fixes Implemented**
   - **API Authentication**: Added Cognito JWT authorizer to all API endpoints
     - All endpoints now require authentication by default
     - Only `/health` endpoint is explicitly public
   - **IAM Security**: Fixed wildcard account ID vulnerability in `createUserTrigger`
     - Replaced `*` with `${aws:accountId}` for proper account scoping
   - **CORS Configuration**: Added proper CORS settings to httpApi
     - Configured allowed origins, headers, and methods
     - Uses frontend URL from SSM parameters
   - **DynamoDB Permissions**: Verified Scan permission is legitimately needed
     - Used for listing quests and processing failed rewards
     - Not a security vulnerability in this context

2. **Frontend Test Coverage Improvements**
   - **Critical Test Fixed**: Implemented previously skipped attestation test
     - Dual-attestation flow now has full test coverage
     - Fixed prop passing between QuestDetail and QuestAttestationForm
     - All QuestDetail tests now passing (8/8)

3. **Backend Testing Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Implemented dependency injection for database client using FastAPI's `Depends()` pattern
   - Removed global `db_client` singleton for better testability
   - Deleted redundant test files (`test_api_basic.py`, `test_unit.py`) that used excessive mocking
   - All integration tests now use proper DI with moto server for realistic testing

4. **E2E Test Configuration Fixed**
   - Updated Playwright authentication setup to work with custom JWT flow
   - Fixed authentication mismatch between tests and actual implementation
   - E2E tests are now functional and ready to run

5. **Security Enhancement: Signature Verification Tests Added**
   - Added comprehensive test suite for cryptographic signature verification
   - Achieved 100% code coverage for src/signature.py
   - Tests cover valid/invalid signatures, edge cases, and integration flows
   - Critical security gap closed - attestation signatures now properly validated

6. **Enhanced Observability**
   - Enabled AWS X-Ray tracing for Lambda functions and API Gateway
   - Added CloudWatch alarm for UserCreationDLQ to monitor stuck messages

7. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Consolidated all testing documentation into `docs/TESTING.md` as single source of truth
   - Simplified CONTRIBUTING.md by removing redundant testing details
   - Added deprecation notices to outdated docs
   - Updated README.md with correct authentication description

## Remaining Tasks & Priorities

### 🚨 High Priority (Before Production)
1. **Branch Strategy**: Merge `testing-infrastructure` branch to `main`
   - Current work is on feature branch
   - Needs PR review and merge before deployment

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Within 1 Week)
1. **Frontend Error Monitoring**: Implement Sentry or similar
   - Currently no visibility into client-side errors
   - Critical for production observability
2. **Structured Logging**: Implement AWS Lambda Powertools
   - Ensure consistent JSON logging format
   - Required for CloudWatch metric filters to work properly

### 🟢 Low Priority (Future Improvements)
1. **Standardize Failure Handling**
   - Consolidate SQS DLQ and custom retry patterns
   - Move all to DynamoDB-based retry mechanism
2. **Granular API Error Alerting**
   - Create specific alarms for critical endpoints
   - Separate from general API error monitoring
3. **Component Documentation**: Complete remaining docs
4. **E2E Test Expansion**: Cover more user flows
5. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Gradual adoption

## Technical Debt

### Addressed
- ✅ API authentication vulnerability (fixed)
- ✅ IAM security issues (fixed)
- ✅ Frontend attestation test gap (fixed)
- ✅ CORS configuration (fixed)

### Remaining
1. Inconsistent error handling patterns between functions
2. Frontend lacks error boundary reporting
3. Some test files have anti-patterns (test_coverage_booster.py)
4. CSS duplication across components

## Metrics

### Code Quality
| Metric | Backend | Frontend | Target |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 85.78% | 71.17% | 70% |
| Tests Passing | 100% (269/269) | 98.97% (96/97) | 100% |
| Type Safety | Full | Partial | Full |
| Linting | Clean | Clean | Clean |

### Performance (Development Environment)
- API Response Time: <200ms average
- Frontend Build Time: ~3s
- Test Suite Runtime: ~30s
- Bundle Size: ~250KB gzipped

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Deployment Blockers**: Critical issues identified - see [HANDOVER.md](./HANDOVER.md) for action plan

### Medium Risk
1. **Documentation**: Status information needs updating across multiple files
2. **Test Warnings**: Some React act() warnings remain but don't affect test results
3. **Signature Verification**: Now fully tested with 100% coverage (previously untested)

### Low Risk
1. **Backend Stability**: Well-tested and stable
2. **Infrastructure**: Proven serverless patterns
3. **Security**: Proper authentication implemented

## Team Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Resolve Critical Blockers**: Follow action plan in [HANDOVER.md](./HANDOVER.md)
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all docs reflect current project state

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Deploy to Staging**: Once tests pass
2. **E2E Test Expansion**: Cover all critical paths
3. **Performance Testing**: Load test the API

### Long-term (Next Month)
1. **Feature Enhancements**: Based on user feedback
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve mobile experience
