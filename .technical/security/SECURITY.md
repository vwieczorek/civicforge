# Security Policy

## Overview

CivicForge takes security seriously. Our hybrid agent model is designed with security and privacy as fundamental principles, not afterthoughts.

## Security Architecture

### Local Controller Security
- **Key Storage**: All cryptographic keys stored in platform secure enclave/keychain
- **No Remote Access**: Local Controller has no remote administration capability
- **User Sovereignty**: No backdoors or override mechanisms
- **Signed Updates**: All updates cryptographically signed

### Remote Thinker Security
- **Zero Knowledge**: Operates without access to user private data
- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS
- **Encrypted Communication**: TLS 1.3 minimum

### Communication Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All Controller-Thinker communication encrypted
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both components verify each other
- **Action Signatures**: All actions cryptographically signed
- **No Replay**: Nonce-based replay attack prevention

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: security@civicforge.org (PGP key available)
2. **Encrypted Form**: https://civicforge.org/security
3. **Bug Bounty**: See https://civicforge.org/bounty

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Our Commitment
