## What is CivicForge?

CivicForge helps you discover meaningful ways to contribute to your community through natural conversation with AI. Think of it as a "Civic Compass" - it points you toward opportunities that match your interests, skills, and availability while protecting your privacy.

## How It Works

### 1. You Talk, We Listen
Instead of browsing lists or filling forms, just tell CivicForge what you're thinking:
- "I have a few hours free this weekend"
- "I'd like to help elderly neighbors"
- "I'm good at teaching and have patience"

### 2. AI Suggests, You Decide
CivicForge finds opportunities that match what you said:
- Local food bank needs Saturday volunteers
- Senior center seeks computer skills teachers
- Community garden welcomes new helpers

### 3. You Stay in Control
Before anything happens, you approve:
- See exactly what information will be shared
- Modify or decline any suggestion
- Change your mind anytime

## Key Features

### üîí Privacy First
- Your personal data stays on your device
- Share only what you choose

    3. Story time at the Library (1 hour)
```

**Skill-Based Matching:**

AI: Several nonprofits need technical help:
    1. Animal shelter needs website updates
    2. Youth center wants online scheduling system
    3. Food bank needs inventory database
```

**Q: Can I use this for my organization?**
A: Soon! We're building tools for organizations to list opportunities and connect with volunteers.
