"Beach cleanup needs morning people" <emphasis level="moderate">Everyone</emphasis> [Swipe left sound] NO MATCH (because morning people are mythical) [Regular voice] But seriously, your <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> agent is like having the world's best matchmaker for civic engagement. It knows what you're good at, when you're free, and what makes you tick. The difference? No awkward first dates. No ghosting. Just real connections with real impact. And unlike actual Tinder, when someone says they need help moving... they actually need help moving. Tomorrow: "We Almost Built Skynet (Oops)" <break time="2s"/> Episode 10: "We Almost Built Skynet (Oops)" [Ominous music] CONFESSION TIME: We almost created a civic surveillance nightmare. Picture this: An <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> that knows EVERYTHING. Your schedule. Your skills. Your network. Your deepest desire to avoid committee meetings. [Sinister voice] "Hello, Dave. I see you're free Tuesday evening. You WILL attend the zoning board meeting. Resistance is futile." [Record scratch] Yeah, we freaked out too. So we burned it all down and started over with privacy-first design. Now your data lives on YOUR device. The <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> operates on encrypted proofs. It's like having a assistant who's really good at their job but also wearing a blindfold. We call it the Zero-Knowledge Thinker. Because Big Brother is cancelled, but Big Helper is totally cool. Tomorrow: "Real Stories from Real Humans (We Didn't Make These Up)" <break time="2s"/> Episode 11: "Elena's Story" [Gentle music] Okay, getting real for a second. Elena's a retired teacher. Her daughter set up <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɪvɪk fɔrdʒ">CivicForge</phoneme> on her phone. Elena was like "I don't do apps." Next morning, her phone suggests: "Elementary school needs story time volunteers. Thursday mornings. Want to help?" One word: "Yes." That's it. No forms. No background check hassles (<say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> handled it). No scheduling nightmares. Six months later? Elena's read to 200 kids. She knows their names. They hug her in grocery stores. She told us: [Elena's voice] "I always wanted to help, but the computer stuff... I just couldn't. Now I just say yes." [Pause] THAT'S the point. Not the fancy <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as>. Not the zero-knowledge whatever. Just... people helping people, without the BS in between. Final episode tomorrow: "What Happens Next" <break time="2s"/> Episode 12: "The Future Is Already Here" [Futuristic music that's also somehow warm] So what's next? We're not here to sell you anything. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɪvɪk fɔrdʒ">CivicForge</phoneme> is open source. Community-owned. Free to use. We're here because we're TIRED of: - 47-page PDFs - Broken government websites - Good intentions dying in committee - Democracy with a price tag - Surveillance capitalism in a civic costume We're building something different. <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> that amplifies human connection instead of replacing it. Tech that disappears so community can flourish. Want to help? (See what we did there?) Just say yes. civicforge.org github.com/civicforge/ai-first [Pause] Oh, and that pothole from Episode 2? [Happily] Fixed in 3 days. You're welcome, neighbor. <break time="2s"/>
