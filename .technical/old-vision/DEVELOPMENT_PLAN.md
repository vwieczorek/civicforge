# CivicForge Development Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of CivicForge from prototype to production, implementing the hybrid agent model that preserves human agency while leveraging AI capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### Hybrid Agent Model
- **Local Controller**: User's device (mobile/desktop) - owns identity, enforces consent
- **Remote Thinker**: Cloud service - provides intelligence without accessing private data
- **Communication**: Encrypted, consent-based protocol between components

### Technology Stack
- **Local Controller**: React Native (mobile), Electron (desktop)
- **Remote Thinker**: Node.js + Fastify
- **Communication**: tRPC for type safety
- **Identity**: W3C DIDs
- **Storage**: Local SQLite + Remote PostgreSQL
- **P2P**: libp2p (future phases)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Months 1-3)
**Goal**: Prove the hybrid agent model with basic civic discovery

**Deliverables**:
- Local Controller CLI/mobile app with approval flow
- Remote Thinker API for opportunity discovery
- Basic conversation interface
- Simple opportunity matching
- End-to-end consent protocol demonstration

**Technical Priorities**:
- Set up monorepo with shared types
- Implement secure Local Controller storage
- Build Remote Thinker with mock data
- Create approval UI/UX
- Establish CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Trust & Identity (Months 4-6)
**Goal**: Add decentralized identity and reputation

**Deliverables**:
- DID implementation (did:web initially)
- Cryptographic signing of actions
- Basic reputation system
- Verifiable credentials for skills
- Privacy budget implementation

**Technical Priorities**:
- Integrate DID libraries
- Implement key management
- Build reputation calculation
- Create credential schemas
- Add privacy tracking

### Phase 3: Federation & Scale (Months 7-9)
**Goal**: Enable community-run infrastructure

**Deliverables**:
- Community Hub specification
- Hub deployment tools
- Inter-hub communication
- Distributed opportunity discovery
- Offline-first capabilities

**Technical Priorities**:
- Design hub federation protocol
- Implement hub discovery
- Add sync mechanisms
- Build deployment automation
- Create hub admin tools

### Phase 4: Advanced Privacy & Decentralization (Months 10-12)
**Goal**: Full privacy-preserving decentralized operation

**Deliverables**:
- P2P agent communication
- Privacy-preserving matching
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Homomorphic encryption (if feasible)
- Complete decentralization

**Technical Priorities**:
- Integrate libp2p
- Implement secure multiparty computation
- Add ZK proof generation/verification
- Optimize privacy computations
- Full protocol documentation

## Progressive Decentralization Strategy

### Stage 1: Centralized with Privacy (MVP)
- Single Remote Thinker instance
- Local Controllers connect via HTTPS
- Focus on consent protocol and UX

### Stage 2: Federated Hubs
- Organizations run Remote Thinker instances
- Hubs share opportunity data
- Users choose their hub

### Stage 3: Hybrid Network
- P2P discovery between hubs
- Direct agent-to-agent for some operations
- Centralized fallback available

### Stage 4: Full Decentralization
- Complete P2P network
- No central dependencies
- Community governance

## Development Priorities

### Security First
- All data encrypted at rest
- Keys in secure enclave/keychain
- Input validation everywhere
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits

### Privacy by Design
- Minimal data collection
- Local processing preferred
- Explicit consent for all sharing
- Privacy budget enforcement
- Right to deletion

### User Experience
- Conversational interface
- Sub-second response times
- Offline functionality
- Clear privacy indicators
- Seamless approval flow

### Developer Experience
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type safety throughout
- Automated testing
- Easy local development
- Clear contribution guide

## Technical Specifications

### API Design
```typescript
// Core interfaces
interface ActionProposal {
  id: string
  type: ActionType
  summary: string
  privacyImpact: PrivacyImpact
  expiresAt: Date
}

interface ConsentDecision {
  approved: boolean
  signature?: string
  modifications?: any
}
```

### Privacy Controls
- Fuzzy location (adjustable precision)
- Time generalization
- Differential privacy for queries
- Homomorphic encryption (future)

### Performance Targets
- Local Controller response: <100ms
- Remote Thinker query: <500ms
- P2P discovery: <1s
- End-to-end flow: <2s

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- 90% code coverage target
- Test all privacy functions
- Validate consent flows
- Mock external services

### Integration Testing
- Full user journeys
- Multi-agent scenarios
- Network failure handling
- Privacy budget enforcement

### Security Testing
- Penetration testing
- Fuzzing inputs
- Cryptographic validation
- Privacy leak detection

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Controller
- App stores (iOS/Android)
- Direct download (desktop)
- Auto-update mechanism
- Staged rollouts

### Remote Thinker
- Container-based deployment
- Horizontal scaling
- Blue-green deployments
- Monitoring and alerting

### Community Hubs
- Docker images provided
- Ansible playbooks
- Terraform modules
- Operations documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- 99.9% uptime
- <2s user journeys
- Zero privacy breaches
- 90% test coverage

### User
- 80% approval completion rate
- <30s onboarding
- 70% weekly active retention
- 4.5+ app store rating

### Community
- 10+ community hubs
- 1000+ opportunities listed
- 50+ contributing developers
- 5+ hub operators

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Privacy computation performance**: Start with conventional methods
- **P2P reliability**: Implement fallbacks and caching
- **Mobile battery drain**: Optimize local processing
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from start

### Adoption Risks
- **Consent fatigue**: Smart defaults and batching
- **Technical complexity**: Hide complexity in UX
- **Network effects**: Seed with quality opportunities
- **Trust building**: Start with known organizations

## Next Steps

1. Set up monorepo structure
2. Implement basic Local Controller
3. Create Remote Thinker API
4. Design approval UI/UX
5. Begin user testing

The path is clear. Let's build infrastructure for human flourishing in the age of AI.
