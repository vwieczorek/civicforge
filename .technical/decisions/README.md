# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains the architectural decisions for the CivicForge project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Index

- [ADR-001](001-hybrid-agent-model.md): Hybrid Agent Model for Privacy and Power
- [ADR-002](002-federated-network.md): Federated P2P Network Over Pure Decentralization  
- [ADR-003](003-privacy-by-design.md): Privacy-Preserving Architecture

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new file: `docs/adr/XXX-short-title.md`
2. Follow the template:
   - **Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded
   - **Context**: What is the issue we're facing?
   - **Decision**: What are we going to do?
   - **Consequences**: What happens as a result?

## Why ADRs?

- Document the "why" behind decisions
- Onboard new team members faster
- Avoid re-litigating past decisions
- Track evolution of architecture over time
