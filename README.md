# CivicForge

*Strengthening communities through simple conversations.*

## Supporting Community Connections

Every community has people who want to help and organizations that need support. CivicForge brings them together through the power of conversation‚Äîmaking civic engagement as natural as talking with a neighbor.

```
You: "I have two hours free this weekend and want to help"

CivicForge: "I found three opportunities nearby:
- Beach cleanup Saturday morning (1.5 hours)
- Food bank needs drivers (2 hour shifts)
- Library seeks reading volunteers (flexible)

The beach cleanup matches your environmental interests. Should I connect you with the organizer?"
```

## How CivicForge Works

### üí¨ Conversational Interface
Share your interests and availability through simple dialogue. Our system attempts to understand everyday language, though it's still learning and improving.

### ü§ù People First  
CivicForge is designed as a tool to help you find local opportunities. You remain in control of what you share and how you participate.

### üîí Privacy Considerations
We aim to keep your information secure by storing sensitive data locally when possible. You choose what to share and when.

### üåê Community Focus
CivicForge is designed to be run by communities, for communities. No single entity controls the network.


## Example Connections

- A resident interested in environmental work finds a local park cleanup

- A teacher finds tutoring opportunities at the library
- A neighbor with a truck helps seniors move furniture
- A gardening enthusiast discovers available community garden plots

These are just examples‚Äîyour community's needs and opportunities will be unique.

**Phase 1** ‚úÖ Basic conversation and matching engine  
**Phase 2** üöß Privacy improvements and data storage  
**Phase 3** üìã Decentralized identity implementation  

See our [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for more details.
