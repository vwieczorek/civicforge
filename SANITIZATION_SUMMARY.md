# Project Sanitization Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Moved Internal Documents to `.internal/` Directory
The following files have been moved out of the public repository:
- `HANDOVER.md` - Development handover notes
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md` - Security vulnerability planning  
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Detailed security findings
- `backend/SECURITY_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Security fix validation

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added exclusions for:
- `.env.development` and `.env.production` files
- `frontend/.env` files specifically
- Internal documentation patterns (`*_PLAN.md`, `*_REPORT.md`)
- `.internal/` directory

### 3. Security Documentation
- Created `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting guidelines
- Added security best practices documentation
- Documented known security considerations

### 4. Fixed Documentation Accuracy
- Updated README.md with correct test coverage (73% backend, not 88%)
- Verified all deployment guides are accurate

### 5. Environment Variables
- Frontend already has `.env.example` with placeholders
- Backend uses `.env.test` for test configuration only

## Remaining Actions Required

### CRITICAL - Before Public Release:

1. **Remove Exposed Cognito Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Remove the committed .env files from frontend
   git rm frontend/.env frontend/.env.development
   git commit -m "Remove exposed environment files"
   ```

2. **Rotate AWS Cognito Credentials**
   - The exposed credentials in `frontend/.env` must be rotated
   - Create new Cognito User Pool or update client ID

3. **Clean Git History** (if making repository public)
   ```bash
   # Use BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch to remove sensitive files from history
   # This is destructive - backup first!
   ```

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for all secrets
   - Never commit actual credentials

2. **Access Control**
   - Keep `.internal/` documents in a separate private repository
   - Use proper IAM roles instead of access keys

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms as specified in serverless.yml

## Verification Checklist

- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [x] Internal planning documents moved to `.internal/`
- [x] .gitignore updated to exclude sensitive files
- [x] Documentation accuracy verified
- [x] Security policy documented
- [ ] Frontend .env files removed from repository
- [ ] Cognito credentials rotated
- [ ] Git history cleaned (if needed)

## Notes

The project follows security best practices overall, but the exposed Cognito credentials in the frontend environment files must be addressed before any public release. These IDs are somewhat public by nature (they're sent to browsers), but should still be managed properly through deployment configurations rather than committed to version control.
