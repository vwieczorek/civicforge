# Project Sanitization Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Moved Internal Documents to `.internal/` Directory
The following files have been moved out of the public repository:
- `HANDOVER.md` - Development handover notes
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md` - Security vulnerability planning  
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Detailed security findings
- `backend/SECURITY_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Security fix validation

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added exclusions for:
- `.env.development` and `.env.production` files
- `frontend/.env` files specifically
- Internal documentation patterns (`*_PLAN.md`, `*_REPORT.md`)
- `.internal/` directory

### 3. Security Documentation
- Created `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting guidelines
- Added security best practices documentation
- Documented known security considerations

### 4. Fixed Documentation Accuracy
- Updated README.md with correct test coverage (73% backend, not 88%)
- Verified all deployment guides are accurate

### 5. Environment Variables
- Frontend already has `.env.example` with placeholders
- Backend uses `.env.test` for test configuration only

## Actions Completed

### Environment Files Removed
- ✅ Deleted `frontend/.env` and `frontend/.env.development` from filesystem
- ✅ Verified files were never committed to repository (only existed locally)
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude these files

### Credential Rotation Scripts Created
- ✅ Created `scripts/rotate_cognito_credentials.sh` - Automated credential rotation
- ✅ Created `scripts/clean_git_history.sh` - Git history cleanup guide

## Remaining Actions Required

### CRITICAL - Execute Credential Rotation:

1. **Run Cognito Rotation Script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rotate_cognito_credentials.sh dev us-east-1
   ```
   This will:
   - Create new App Client ID
   - Update SSM parameters
   - Delete old App Client
   - Create new `.env.local` file

2. **Clean Git History** (ONLY if credentials were previously committed)
   ```bash
   # First check if cleanup is needed:
   git grep -i "us-east-1_wKpnasV5v" $(git rev-list --all)
   
   # If found, follow instructions in:
   ./scripts/clean_git_history.sh
   ```

3. **Redeploy Services**
   - Backend: `serverless deploy --stage dev`
   - Update frontend deployments with new credentials

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for all secrets
   - Never commit actual credentials

2. **Access Control**
   - Keep `.internal/` documents in a separate private repository
   - Use proper IAM roles instead of access keys

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms as specified in serverless.yml

## Verification Checklist

- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [x] Internal planning documents moved to `.internal/`
- [x] .gitignore updated to exclude sensitive files
- [x] Documentation accuracy verified
- [x] Security policy documented
- [ ] Frontend .env files removed from repository
- [ ] Cognito credentials rotated
- [ ] Git history cleaned (if needed)

## Notes

The project follows security best practices overall, but the exposed Cognito credentials in the frontend environment files must be addressed before any public release. These IDs are somewhat public by nature (they're sent to browsers), but should still be managed properly through deployment configurations rather than committed to version control.
