## What's New

We've upgraded from the mock demo to the **real Phase 1 implementation**:
- ✅ Natural language understanding of your civic interests
- ✅ Entity extraction (skills, times, locations)
- ✅ Smart matching algorithm (83% accuracy)
- ✅ Interactive conversation interface
- ✅ Full API at http://localhost:8000/docs

## Legacy Mock Demo

The original mock demo files are preserved here for reference:
- `demo.sh` - Original launcher (now use `../demo.sh` for real version)
- `local.js` - Mock privacy guardian 
- `server.py` - Mock conversation AI
