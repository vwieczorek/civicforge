# Member Removal Bug Fix Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully fixed the member removal bug that was causing 500 errors!

## The Issue

The `remove_board_member` endpoint was trying to access `result.rowcount` on the PostgreSQL adapter's cursor object, which doesn't have that attribute.

## The Fix

Changed from:
```python
result = db.execute("DELETE FROM board_memberships WHERE board_id=? AND user_id=?", (board_id, user_id))
if result.rowcount == 0:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Member not found")
```

To:
```python
# First check if member exists
existing = db.fetchone("SELECT user_id FROM board_memberships WHERE board_id=? AND user_id=?", (board_id, user_id))
if not existing:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Member not found")

# Delete the member
db.execute("DELETE FROM board_memberships WHERE board_id=? AND user_id=?", (board_id, user_id))
db.commit()
```

## Test Results
