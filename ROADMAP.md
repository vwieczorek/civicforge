# CivicForge Roadmap

> Building the future of civic engagement, one conversation at a time

This roadmap follows a pragmatic "Crawl, Walk, Run" approach, starting with simple implementations and gradually introducing advanced features as the project matures.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025) - "Crawl"

**Goal**: Establish basic architecture and prove core concepts

### Core Infrastructure

  - [ ] Simple command-line interface
  - [ ] Mock identity management
  - [ ] Basic approval flow for actions
- [ ] Simple Remote Thinker API
  - [ ] FastAPI server with basic endpoints
  - [ ] Mock natural language understanding
  - [ ] Hardcoded opportunity database
- [ ] Communication Protocol
  - [ ] Define JSON message formats
  - [ ] Implement basic request/response flow
  - [ ] Add error handling

### Developer Experience  
- [ ] Expand prototype into structured codebase
- [ ] Add unit tests for core components
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Community Building
- [ ] Launch project website
- [ ] Create demo video using audio scripts
- [ ] Establish Discord/Matrix community
- [ ] First community call

**Deliverable**: Working CLI demo where users can discover and sign up for civic opportunities

## Phase 2: Core Features (Q2 2025) - "Walk"

  - [ ] Support for OpenAI API
  - [ ] Support for local models (Ollama)
  - [ ] Context management system
- [ ] Semantic understanding of civic queries
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation support

### Opportunity Management
- [ ] Real database for opportunities
  - [ ] PostgreSQL with vector extensions
  - [ ] Semantic search capabilities
  - [ ] Geographic indexing
- [ ] Admin interface for adding opportunities
- [ ] Basic matching algorithm

### Mobile Local Controller
- [ ] React Native application
  - [ ] iOS and Android support
  - [ ] Voice input capability
  - [ ] Push notifications for updates
- [ ] Secure storage for user preferences
- [ ] Biometric authentication

### Identity Foundation
- [ ] Implement basic DID system
  - [ ] did:web method for simplicity
  - [ ] Key generation and storage
  - [ ] Credential issuance for completed tasks

**Deliverable**: Mobile app with real AI understanding and persistent opportunity database

## Phase 3: Decentralization (Q3-Q4 2025) - "Run"

**Goal**: Implement the full federated vision

### Federated Network
- [ ] Community Hub implementation
  - [ ] Hub registration protocol
  - [ ] Inter-hub communication
  - [ ] Distributed opportunity discovery
- [ ] P2P agent communication
  - [ ] libp2p integration
  - [ ] DHT for discovery
  - [ ] NAT traversal

### Advanced Privacy
- [ ] Privacy budget implementation
- [ ] Differential privacy for queries
- [ ] Zero-knowledge proofs for reputation
- [ ] Homomorphic encryption experiments

### Trust & Reputation
- [ ] Non-fungible reputation system
- [ ] Verifiable Credentials for contributions
- [ ] Dispute resolution mechanism
- [ ] Community governance tools

### Agent Capabilities
- [ ] Agent-to-agent negotiation
- [ ] Automated scheduling
- [ ] Group coordination features
- [ ] Serendipity slider implementation

**Deliverable**: Fully decentralized civic engagement network

## Beyond 2025: Vision Features

### Advanced Capabilities
- [ ] Blockchain integration for permanent records
- [ ] Advanced privacy protocols (MPC, FHE)
- [ ] Cross-community reputation portability
- [ ] AI safety and alignment features

### Ecosystem Growth
- [ ] SDK for third-party integrations
- [ ] Marketplace for civic opportunities
- [ ] Integration with existing civic platforms
- [ ] International expansion and localization

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1
- 100 developers try the prototype
- 10 active contributors
- 1 working demo deployment

### Phase 2  
- 1,000 beta users
- 50 civic organizations engaged
- 100 opportunities posted

### Phase 3
- 10,000 active users
- 5 community hubs operational
- 1,000 civic actions completed

## How to Contribute

1. **Pick a task** from the current phase
2. **Discuss** in GitHub issues before starting
3. **Submit PR** with tests and documentation
4. **Celebrate** your contribution to civic engagement!

## Principles

- **User agency first** - Technology amplifies, doesn't replace human decision-making
- **Privacy by design** - Not as an afterthought
- **Start simple** - Prove concepts before adding complexity
- **Community-driven** - Users and contributors shape the direction
