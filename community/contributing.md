# Contributing to CivicForge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CivicForge! We're building a conversation-driven approach to civic engagement, and we need thoughtful contributors to help shape this vision.

## Current Phase

CivicForge is in the **prototype and early implementation phase**. We have a working demo and are building the real system with a focus on natural conversation and real community impact.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Understand the Vision
- Read our [README](../README.md) for the story

- See [Implementation Guide](../docs/technical/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for building

### 2. Areas We Need Help

#### Natural Language & AI

### 3. Tech Stack

We use the right tool for each job:
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) - For AI/NLP magic
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React Native - For type-safe, beautiful UIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - Simple, reliable
- **Testing**: Test-first development is required

### 4. How to Submit Ideas

1. **Open an Issue** - Start a discussion about your idea
2. **Be Specific** - Reference which component or principle your idea relates to
3. **Think Human-First** - Remember: AI guides, humans decide

### 5. Design Principles

All contributions should align with our core principles:

- **Human Agency** - Technology amplifies human capability, doesn't replace it
- **Privacy by Design** - Not as an afterthought
- **Community Ownership** - Federated, not centralized
- **Natural Interaction** - Conversation over complexity
- **Inclusive Access** - Works for everyone

### 6. Communication

- **Issues** - For feature discussions and architecture decisions
- **Discussions** - For broader philosophy and approach questions
- **Pull Requests** - Currently only for documentation improvements
