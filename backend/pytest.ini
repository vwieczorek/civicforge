# Test markers for organization
markers =
    integration: Integration tests that exercise multiple components (use TestClient + moto)
    unit: Unit tests for isolated components (minimal mocking)
    slow: Tests that take longer to run
    auth: Authentication-related tests
    db: Database-related tests
    api: API endpoint tests (should contribute most to coverage)
